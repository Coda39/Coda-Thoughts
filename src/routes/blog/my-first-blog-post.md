## This is going to be my first blog post that I will use to showcase whats up with this new website

I have been thinking of doing a blog centered website for quite some time now, but I was always procrastinating because of a miriad of different reasons. The largest being just the sheer amount of ways that you can make a blog these days. From mainly just pre-generated generic websites which may serve the purpose of making your thoughts readable but which strip you of any or at times all creative freedom. To convuluded and tedious hardcoded solutions which drain all your energy creating the site before you even make your first post. To the whole spectrum of options inbetween these two extremes, it can make wanting something as simple as having your little corner where you type your little opinons turn into a herculean task.

So I decided on a relative straightforward approach, finding an easy video tutorial which wasn't too lengthy resulting in this website. Using infrastructure that I have never used such as svelteKit, Tailwind, and MDsveX I was able to create a barebones blog site that prioritized the things I wanted most.

- It utilizes Markdown files as the actual blog posts themselves
- It is relative automatic in the creation of new posts, meaning that I don't have to go about debugging and refactoring some code everytime I just want to write about the newest weezer album or something
- Theres lots of room for improvement and growth

That last one is what gets me most excited, even though I might hate messing around with Javascript, I still enjoy the design and styling of websites which is mainly done here using TailwindCSS and if I am able to use this site to mess around and familirize myself with it then I am more than happy.

What I will write about and how those things that I write about are to be showcased to the world is still up in the air but this is definetely an overdue and neccasary step in the right direction.
